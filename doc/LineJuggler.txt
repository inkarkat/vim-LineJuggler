DESCRIPTION					     *LineJuggler-description*

This plugin offers mappings to quickly duplicate and move lines to above /
below the current line. A [count] either specifies the number of lines, or the
relative visible line, therefore it's especially easy to clone lines when
'relativenumber' is set.

Oftentimes, duplication in source code is a code smell. Please use this plugin
responsibly ;-)

RELATED WORKS								     *

- Idea, design and implementation of the [<Space> and [e mappings are based on
  Tim Pope's unimpaired.vim plugin (vimscript #1590). In addition, it provides
  other, unrelated functionality (all via [... / ]... mappings), and doesn't
  offer customization of the mappings.

USAGE							   *LineJuggler-usage*

						       *[<Space>* *v_[<Space>*
[<Space>                Add [count] blank lines above the current line / above
			the start of the selection.

						       *]<Space>* *v_]<Space>*
]<Space>                Add [count] blank lines below the current line / below
			the end of the selection.

								   *[e* *v_[e*
[e                      Move the current line / selection [count] lines above.

								   *]e* *v_]e*
]e                      Move the current line / selection [count] lines below.

								   *[d* *v_[d*
[d			Duplicate current line / selection [count] lines
			above.
								   *]d* *v_]d*
]d			Duplicate current line / selection [count] lines
			below.

									  *[D*
[D			Duplicate current  / [count] lines above the current
			line.						*v_[D*
{Visual}[D		Duplicate the selection [count] times above the
			selection.
									  *]D*
]D			Duplicate current  / [count] lines below that range.
									*v_]D*
{Visual}]D		Duplicate the selection [count] times below the
			selection.

									  *[f*
[f			Fetch the line [count] visible lines below the current
			line and duplicate it below the current line.
									  *[f*
]f			Fetch the line [count] visible lines above the current
			line and duplicate it below the current line.
									*v_[f*
{Visual}[f		Replace the selected lines with the same number of
			(physical, regardless of their folding state) lines
			fetched starting from the line [count] visible lines
			below the current line.
									*v_]f*
{Visual}]f		Replace the selected lines with the same number of
			(physical, regardless of their folding state) lines
			fetched starting from the line [count] visible lines
			above the current line.


			When the cursor is on / the selection contains a
			closed fold, the entire set of folded lines is used.
			All mappings treat closed folds as a fixed entity, so
			they will never move / duplicate into a closed fold,
			always over it.
			A [count] specifies visible lines, closed folds are
			counted as one line, so you can use the
			'relativenumber' column to easily reach a target.
